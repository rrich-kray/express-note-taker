This repository contains the source code for the Express Note Taker project. This project gave me experience constructing an API for a simple JSON database prior to doing so for a larger-scale project.

## How It Works

Express Note Taker consists of an API constructed with Express routes to access, modify and delete data stored within a simple JSON database.

The frontend is constructed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Users can perform CRUD operations on the database by selecting icons with appropriate event listeners attached. These include an icon located in the upper right-hand corner of the page, as well as trash icons associated with each task.
